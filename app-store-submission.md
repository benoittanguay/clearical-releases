```
Time tracking that respects your time.

Start your timer and forget about it. Clearical captures what you're working on automatically—no manual logging, no interruptions. When you're ready, sync to your timesheet or accounting system with one click.

THE PROBLEM WITH TIME TRACKING

Every knowledge worker knows the ritual: staring at an empty timesheet on Friday, trying to remember what you did on Tuesday. Manual time tracking forces an impossible choice—track obsessively and kill your focus, or track at end of day and lose billable hours to guesswork.

THE CLEARICAL DIFFERENCE

Start your timer, then stay in flow. While it's running, Clearical captures context from your screen, detects meetings automatically, and uses AI to understand what you're working on. When you're ready to log time, everything is already there—organized, described, and ready for one-click submission.

KEY FEATURES

• Automatic Capture — Start your timer and Clearical documents your work as it happens. No manual entries required.

• AI-Powered Descriptions — Smart analysis generates activity summaries so you don't have to remember.

• Meeting Detection — Automatically identifies video calls and captures meeting time. Optional audio recording for transcripts.

• Jira Integration — Browse and link time entries to Jira issues without leaving the app. Smart suggestions learn from your patterns.

• One-Click Tempo Logging — Log an entire week to Tempo in under 60 seconds. Bulk operations with automatic account attribution.

• Privacy-First Design — Screenshot analysis happens on your device, not in the cloud. Blacklist sensitive apps. You control what gets logged.

• Smart Organization — Create buckets and folders to organize time by project, client, or however you work.

• Detailed Worklog — Review your week with visual timelines. Edit, split, and reassign entries before logging.

PERFECT FOR

• Developers who lose flow every time they switch to log time
• Freelancers and consultants who forget billable hours
• Teams who want accurate timesheets without the admin
• Agencies tracking time across multiple clients and projects
• Anyone tired of reconstructing their week from memory

WHAT USERS SAY

"I used to spend 30 minutes every Friday reconstructing my week. Now I spend 2 minutes reviewing what Clearical already captured."

"We discovered we were losing $8K/month on one client because nobody tracked the 'quick' requests. Clearical showed us exactly where our time was going."

BY THE NUMBERS

• Average user recovers $350/month in previously untracked time
• 94% reduction in timesheet follow-up requests for teams
• Less than 5 minutes daily on time admin vs. industry average of 15-30

GETTING STARTED

1. Create a few buckets for your main projects
2. Start your timer and work—Clearical captures in the background
3. Review captured activities at end of day or week
4. One click syncs everything to your timesheet system

INTEGRATIONS

• Jira Cloud
• Tempo Timesheets
• CSV export for custom reporting

PRIVACY & PERMISSIONS

Clearical requires screen recording permission to capture activity context. All screenshot analysis happens locally on your Mac—images never leave your device. You can blacklist any application from capture. Meeting recording requires explicit microphone permission and your consent.

## Localization Notes

This copy is written for English (Canada). If localizing:

- Maintain the calm, confident tone across languages
- "Flow state" may need cultural adaptation in some markets
- Integration names (Jira, Tempo) are global (no localization needed)
- Currency examples ($350/month) should be localized

## App Store Optimization Tips

1. **First 3 lines matter most** — Description is truncated on the store page; lead with value
2. **Keywords are exact match** — "time tracking" won't match "timetracking"
3. **Update Promotional Text regularly** — It can be changed without a new app version
4. **Ratings prompt** — Request ratings after positive moments (successful timesheet sync)
5. **Screenshots sell** — 80% of users decide based on screenshots alone
