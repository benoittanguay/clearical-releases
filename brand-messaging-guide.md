## Brand Foundation

### What Clearical Is

**Clearical** is an automatic time tracking application that captures work passively while professionals stay in flow. It uses AI to understand context, suggests the right projects, and syncs seamlessly with Jira and Tempo for enterprise teams.

### The Problem We Solve

Time tracking is broken. Knowledge workers face an impossible choice:

1. **Track meticulously** → Constant interruptions destroy focus and flow
2. **Track at end of day** → Inaccurate reconstruction, lost billable hours
3. **Don't track at all** → Revenue leakage, no project visibility

The average professional loses 15-30 minutes per day to time tracking friction. For a team of 10, that's 50+ hours per month of lost productivity—spent on the very tool meant to measure productivity.

### Our Solution

Clearical eliminates this choice. It runs silently in the background, capturing work context through:
- Screenshot analysis (AI-powered, privacy-first)
- Window and application monitoring
- Meeting detection and transcription
- Calendar integration

Then it intelligently suggests the right bucket or Jira issue. One click logs to Tempo. No timers. No end-of-week panic. No friction.

### Mission Statement

> **We believe your best work happens when you're not thinking about time.**
>
> Clearical exists to eliminate the friction between doing great work and getting credit for it. We're building a future where time documentation is invisible, accurate, and automatic—so professionals can stay in flow and organizations can make better decisions.

### Vision

A world where no one loses billable hours to forgotten work, and no one breaks focus to track time.

## Voice & Tone

### Brand Personality

Clearical speaks as **The Thoughtful Guide**—someone who deeply understands the frustration of context-switching and offers a calm, confident path forward.

| Trait | Description | In Practice |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **Calm** | We're the antidote to chaos | No urgency tactics, no anxiety-inducing copy |
| **Confident** | We know this works | Direct claims backed by specifics, not hedging |
| **Respectful** | We value your attention | Concise messaging, no interruptions, privacy-first |
| **Warm** | We're human, not corporate | Conversational tone, relatable scenarios |
| **Direct** | We say what we mean | Clear value props, no jargon or buzzwords |

### Voice Spectrum

```
FORMAL ←――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――→ CASUAL
                    ▲
              [Clearical]
         Professional but warm
```

We sit in the **professional-conversational** zone:
- More formal than a friend texting
- Less formal than a bank or law firm
- Peer-to-peer, not vendor-to-customer

### Tone Adjustments by Context

| Context | Tone Shift | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| **Homepage hero** | Confident, aspirational | "Your work, automatically documented." |
| **Feature pages** | Clear, educational | "Clearical detects when you join a video call and can record audio for automatic meeting notes." |
| **Error messages** | Helpful, reassuring | "We couldn't connect to Tempo. Check your API token in Settings." |
| **Onboarding** | Encouraging, patient | "Great start! Let's create your first bucket to organize your time." |
| **Email marketing** | Warm, personalized | "You've been using Clearical for a week now. Here's what we've learned about your workflow." |
| **Social media** | Relatable, slightly playful | "That feeling when you realize it's Friday and you haven't filled out your timesheet all week. Clearical users don't know this feeling." |

### Writing Principles

**1. Lead with the benefit, not the feature**
- No: "AI-powered screenshot analysis"
- Yes: "Know exactly what you worked on without remembering"

**2. Respect the reader's time**
- Headlines: 6-12 words maximum
- Body paragraphs: 2-3 sentences
- Bullet points for scanning

**3. Be specific over generic**
- No: "Save time on time tracking"
- Yes: "Log a full week to Tempo in under 60 seconds"

**4. Show, don't tell**
- No: "Easy to use"
- Yes: "One click from captured time to logged timesheet"

**5. Acknowledge the pain before presenting the solution**
- No: "Clearical automatically tracks your time"
- Yes: "Reconstructing your week from memory is exhausting. Clearical captures it as you work."

## Messaging Architecture

### Positioning Statement

**For** professionals and teams who lose focus and revenue to manual time tracking,
**Clearical** is an automatic time capture app

**Clearical** uses AI to understand context and suggests the right project—so logging takes one click, not fifteen minutes.

### Tagline

**Primary:** "Time tracking that respects your time."

**Alternatives by angle:**

| Developer-centric | "Stay in flow. Get credit for it." |
| Effortless | "Your work, automatically documented." |
| Provocative | "Stop tracking. Start working." |
| Enterprise | "Timesheets that fill themselves." |

Hey [Name],

We noticed you haven't opened Clearical in a week. No judgment—we know time
tracking isn't exactly thrilling.

But here's the thing: Clearical works best when it runs continuously. That's
how the AI learns your patterns and gets scary-accurate at suggestions.

If something's not working, hit reply and tell me. I'll personally help you
get set up.

#### Feature Announcement Email

**Subject:** New: Meeting transcripts, automatically

**Body:**
```
Big update today: Clearical now captures meeting audio and generates transcripts.

Here's how it works:
1. Clearical detects when you join a video call (Zoom, Meet, Teams, etc.)
2. With your permission, it records the audio
3. After the call, you get a searchable transcript

This means:
• Meeting time logged automatically to the right project
• Searchable record of what was discussed
• No more "what did we decide on that call?"

The feature is available now in Settings → Meeting Detection.

### Social Media

#### LinkedIn

**Post 1: Pain point + solution**
```
Every Friday at 4pm, knowledge workers across the world open their timesheet
software and try to remember what they did on Tuesday.

This ritual costs companies millions in:
• Lost billable hours (conservatively 10-15% leakage)
• Productivity lost to reconstruction
• Project data so inaccurate it's useless

There's a better way. Automatic time capture that runs silently while you work.

No timers to start. No memory required. Just accurate data and one-click logging.

We built Clearical because we were tired of this ritual too.

#timetracking #productivity #remotework
```

**Post 2: Contrarian take**
```
Hot take: Time tracking makes you less productive.

Not the concept—the execution.

Starting a timer = context switch.
Stopping a timer = context switch.
Categorizing time = context switch.
Forgetting to track = anxiety + guesswork.

The solution isn't "better discipline." It's removing the friction entirely.

Automatic capture. AI categorization. One-click logging.

Time tracking shouldn't cost you time.
```

**Post 3: Social proof**
```
"I used to spend 30 minutes every Friday reconstructing my week. Now I spend
2 minutes reviewing what Clearical already captured."

— Real quote from a user last week.

The math:
• 28 minutes saved per week
• 24 hours saved per year
• Plus: more accurate data, less stress, no forgotten billable hours

What would you do with an extra 24 hours?
```

#### Twitter/X

**Tweet 1:**
```
Time tracking is broken.

You either:
- Track obsessively → kill your focus
- Track at end of day → guess and lose hours
- Don't track → no project visibility

We built a third option: automatic capture while you work.

No timers. No interruptions. Just data.
```

**Tweet 2:**
```
The irony of time tracking:

The tool meant to make you more productive... makes you less productive.

Every timer start = context switch
Every category selection = decision fatigue
Every forgotten entry = anxiety

What if it just... happened automatically?
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
Friday 4pm energy: staring at an empty timesheet trying to remember what you
did on Tuesday.

There's a better way.
```

## Competitive Positioning

### Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Their Position | Our Differentiation |
|------------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Toggl** | "Simple time tracking" | Manual timers = context switching. We're automatic. |
| **Harvest** | "Time tracking & invoicing" | Still requires manual entry. We capture passively. |
| **Clockify** | "Free time tracker" | Free but manual. Time cost > subscription cost. |
| **RescueTime** | "Automatic time tracking" | Passive monitoring, no logging integration. We connect to Jira/Tempo. |
| **Hubstaff** | "Employee monitoring" | Surveillance-focused. We're privacy-first, user-controlled. |
| **Tempo Timesheets** | "Jira time tracking" | Manual entry in Jira. We're the automatic front-end. |

### Positioning Against Manual Trackers (Toggl, Harvest, Clockify)

**Their pitch:** "Just start a timer when you begin a task."

**Our response:**
Every timer start is a context switch. Every forgotten timer is lost data.
Manual tracking trades productivity for data—we give you both.

**Key differentiators:**
- No timers = no context switching
- AI categorization = no decision fatigue
- Passive capture = no forgotten hours

---

### Positioning Against Monitoring Software (Hubstaff, Time Doctor)

**Their pitch:** "Know what your team is working on."

**Our response:**
Monitoring breeds distrust. Clearical is user-controlled—professionals capture
their own time, review before syncing, and maintain privacy. Better data comes
from empowerment, not surveillance.

**Key differentiators:**
- User-controlled, not employer-surveillance
- On-device processing, not cloud monitoring
- Designed for professionals, not hourly workers

---

### Positioning Against Tempo (Native Jira Timesheet)

**Their pitch:** "Time tracking in Jira."

**Our response:**
Tempo is where time goes. Clearical is where time comes from. We're not
replacing Tempo—we're eliminating the friction of filling it out.

**Key differentiators:**
- Automatic capture vs manual entry
- Works while you work vs requires tab switching
- One-click bulk logging vs entry-by-entry

---
